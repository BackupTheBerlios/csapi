<h1>Setting preferences</h1>

<h2>The preference page</h2>
<p>Before any action, you have to indicate to the plugin the user, role and 
password to be used to connect. Also, some technical information are needed:
the location of your Synergy/Change server, and the path to the database 
on server.</p>

<ul>
<li>The login is the identifier used to connect through the normal web 
interface of Synergy/Change.</li>
<li>Password is the password used when connecting through the normal web 
interface of Synergy/Change.</li>
<li>Role is the CS Role that is selected when you connect through the normal
web interface of Synergy/Change.</li>
<li>The server IP and port of the server must be entered sepated by colons: 
ip.ad.dr.ess:port for example. The default port is 8600.</li>
<li>The path to the database on the server is partly written on the web interface
login page, but you probably will have to ask your local administrator for
this information.</li>
</ul>
