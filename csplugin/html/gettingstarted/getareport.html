<h1>Get a Report</h1>

<h2>Login</h2>
<p>Like any Synergy/Change session, you first have to login. If your 
preferences have been correctly set, just hit 'Login' from the menu 'S/Change'.
</p>

<h2>Get Report...</h2>

<p>Once you have signed up, you can execute as many reports or actions as you 
wish: the same token will be used when connecting, and your session will 
expire on an idle delay -- just as a normal web Synergy/Change session.</p>

<p>Synergy/Change requires to know the query to be executed to filter records
from the datase, and attributes to be displayed in query. The query uses
the same syntax than the web 'Query' facility, with all AND and OR complex 
constructions available.</p>

<p>The plugin then asks for the attributes to be retrieved. Specifiy all 
needed attributes (intern names), separated with pipes.</p>

<p>The result of report is then displayed in the CS Report view. The view 
displays appears automatically if not visible. The following picture has been 
shot with the CS Report view fullscreen.</p>

<h2>Get a text report</h2>

<p>Once the report is displayed in the CS Report view, the view menu provides a
'To Text...' action. Clicking on it raises a file selection dialog. Enter the
name of the file to write in (default is report.txt).</p>
